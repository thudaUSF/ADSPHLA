# ADSPHLA
Using case and control data from ADSP as well as HLA alleles, processes various statistical tests.

Note that the "Replicative" script was an edit of the original script in order to process the HLA testing correction, which is done by moving a random % of cases from the in-group and moving it to the opposite group, and seeing if the statistical test held true. Other tests e.g. age of onset were removed from the script.
